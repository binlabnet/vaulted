Multi purpose cryptography tool for encryption/decryption using AES256 GCM.

A "swiss-army" encryption/decryption knife with focus on developer experience, ease-of-use and
 integration capabilities in infrastructure-as-code software such as https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform.

Combined with https://github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted, it's shown 
 at https://medium.com/@syndbg/provisioning-vault-encrypted-secrets-using-terraform-using-sumup-oss-vaulted-and-4aa9721d082c?source=friends_link&sk=9eabe1bbe6ba089fe176d94cf413862d

## Why

* Ease-of-use.
* First-class terraform support. Also check https://github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted/.
* Asymmetric encryption.
* **Large files are supported due to AES256 GCM encryption/decryption used.**
* GPG/PGP keychain-less which means you don't need external GPG/PGP keychain and neither do your users. (Support for this may be added in the future)
* Completely testable and high test coverage consisting of unit, integration and e2e tests.
* Encryption,
* Decryption,
* Secret rotation,
* Secret re-keying.

## [How it works](./HOW_IT_WORKS.md)

## Used in:
 
* https://github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted to provide encryption/decryption capabilities.
* SumUp inner-source large-scale provision orchestration software projects.
* SumUp inner-source projects that deploy using Ansible. Used to encrypt/decrypt the initial Ansible-Vault passphrase.
* SumUp infrastructure provisioning via Terraform to provide Vault secrets and enable developers to 
 encrypt and submit secrets as PRs without anyone other than system administrators, devops, 
 site-reliability engineers be able to decrypt them.
* SumUp inner-source CI systems that need to encrypt/decrypt secrets in sandboxes.

## Prerequisites

1. RSA public and private key pair for asymmetric encryption (using `openssl`, `cfssl` or whichever works for you).

## Setup

### Generating a private key pair for asymmetric encryption

```shell
# Generate PKCS#1 private key
> openssl genrsa -f4 -out private.pem 4096
# Generate from private key, a public key
> openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

### I already have keys

**Make sure that your private and public keys are PEM-formatted**.

Example valid public key

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

**Your private key must be `PKCS#1`-formatted**.

Example `PKCS#1`-formatted private key

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
<content>
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Example **unusable** with `vaulted` `PKCS#8`-formatted private key

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
<content>
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**What is the difference in base64-encoded content?** 

Obvious different is in the PEM block names.

However in terms of content, `PKCS#8` PEM contains the `version` and `algorithm` identifiers and 
 `private key` content.

The `PKCS#1` PEM contains just the `private key` content.
